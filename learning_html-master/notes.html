<h1> URL </h1>

<p> URL stands for *Uniform Resource Locator*. It contains serveral different parts, including: 
<ul>
<li>the <strong> protocol </strong>: e.g. http, https, ftp </li>
<li> the <b>host </b>: e.g. www.facebook.com, www.bbc.co.uk </li>
<li>the <b>path </b>: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95 </li>
</ul>


<h2> DNS </h2>

<p> DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.



 <h2> Server-side vs. Client-side technologies </h2>

 <h2> Client-side  </h2>

<p> Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript



<h2> Server-side </h2>



<h2>Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here. </h2>
